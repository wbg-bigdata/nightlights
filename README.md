The front end for the India Lights project.

## Build

- `npm run build` - clean & build everything and put it into dist folder
- `npm run serve` - serve the pages and utilize live reload on changes to
  styles, fonts, images, scripts and HTML.  Run this and then open up
  [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) in your browser.
- `API_URL='http://whatever.blah:1337' npm run serve` - same as above, but
  point the site at the specified API url. By default, this will be the
  nighlights API at http://api.nightlights.io.
